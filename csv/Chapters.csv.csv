Shooting Locaitons,media/IMG_0749.jpg,Source: Alena Zuckerman,,"One of my favorite benefits of working in the film and production industry is the different shooting locations that each set brings me to. Shooting locations are chosen based on the aesthetic that the director and director of photography are hoping to achieve. Within these sets, it is up to the production design, grip, and electric teams to transform the location into a place no one imagined. Fortunately, I am a part of the grip and electric teams that create the lighting for these locations which brings a significant amount of emotion to a film. Let's explore some of the places film has brought me!<br><br>",16,Numbered,violet,Florida International University,25.756324,-80.37271605,,,,
CineVideoTeach ,media/IMG_7515.jpg,Source: Alena Zuckerman,,"Roughly one year ago, I stumbled upon a place where I had no idea how many doors it would open for me. The first shooting location on our list is CineVideoTech. Within these walls, I was given my first opportunity to learn film equipment and start retaining the knowledge needed to succeed in the industry. Within a month of coming around the warehouse, they had an in-house production that lasted around two months in which I had the chance to apply my skills and keep learning significantly more. <br><br> The onwer and his wife continue to educate me on industry equipment and bring me onto new sets.

Plantation,media/IMG_9904.jpg,Source: Alena Zuckerman,,"By October 2023, I was fortunate enough to receive my first paid film gig where the location was a beautiful mansion in Plantation, Florida. This shooting location is available to be rented out to low or high-budget films looking to shoot in Miami. It has 8 beds, 6 baths, a pool, a theater room, and a game room. Ultimately making it (in my head) the nicest location for one's first paid film set. The cast and crew took over the house for one week. <br><br>In this week, we transformed this location into a social media influencer house where we followed the perspective of a girl who feels like an outcast. The film is being submitted to festivals with hopes of being a television series. Unfortunately, I can't say much more than that ;)",16,3,violet,First Paid Film GIg Location,26.12801559,-80.30966815,,,,
Homestead,media/IMG_0647.jpg,Source: Alena Zuckerman,,"The most recent student film set I was on was located in Homestead, Florida. This student set also happens to be my favorite student set because of the remote location.  Homestead is where a large agricultural community resides producing fruits, vegetables, and plants to be sold wholesale. <br><br> On this shoot, I had the opportunity to be the Key Grip overseeing a car rigging setup. The team and I took a couple of days to prepare for this task to ensure the risky yet secure rigging we were doing was sturdy. The car drove for 3/4 of a mile through Homestead to achieve the shot being requested. <br><br> Before this shoot, I never thought about driving to Homestead to see what is has to offer. However, once I saw the acres upon acres of crops and homes nestled in between, I did not want to leave. One of the downsides to living in a major city like Miami is that we miss out on the tranquility that being out in rural areas brings us. Out in Homestead,  you can feel the morning dew, breathe fresh air, and even see the stars clearly. It is simply not the same as living in Miami and we forget that.

Everglades ,media/IMG_0809.jpg,Source: Alena Zuckerman,,"A student set that I was very fortunate to be a part of was shot in the Everglades. The writer and director of this music video is a lady that I look very up to very fondly in the production industry. She has continued to push me to step up to the plate and test my abilities in the crazy industry that we call work. <br><br> The concept of the music video was to showcase her journey through the trials and tribulations that life has faced her. While in the Everglades, the scene was this lady driving down a dirty road to eventually pull out a body bag from the bed of a truck and shoot at it. Signifying the end of the person she used to be. It was special seeing this vulnerable side of this lady I look up to because she tends to have a hard exterior. <br><br> Moreover, this shoot was very physically tasking for me as I was the only person asked to be in the grip and electric department. The grip and electric department tends to have a minimum of 3 people regardless of the tasks required. Being the only person in my department, it was up to me to ensure the lighting and rigging being asked for were set up properly. Additionally, we shot at night in December, i.e. it was very cold for Miami. <br><br> With all things being said, I could not have been more thankful to be on this set. It proved that all of the skills I learned over a short timeframe could be seen without the cushioning of overs. ",,5,violet,First Shoot as Key Grip,25.76216886,-80.51270934,,,,
Kendall,media/IMG_0604.jpg,Source: Alena Zuckerman,," Being new in the film industry, it is hard to find gigs because you have to have someone who takes a chance on you. Luckily for me, the owners of CineVideoTech took another leap of faith with me and asked if I would assist them on a short that they were making. This location will always resonate close to my heart because it was the location of my second paid film set <br><br>However, it was not the location that made this set so special, it was the camera that we used. The company that hired us had just acquired an Arri Alexa Mini LF. This is a large format camera meaning it can produce image resolutions significantly higher than standard film cameras. The Mini LF is one of the leading industry cameras with 94% of the Oscar nominations using it for their productions. We also used an invention called the spider cam, which allows the camera to move fluidly at the lowest point it can reach the floor. <br><br> It was a unique experience seeing these industry tools put together.",17,6,violet,Second Paid Film Set ,25.69199917,-80.28520668,,,,
Jacksonville ,media/IMG_9075.jpg,Source: Alena Zuckerman,,"Our final stop on the ""Places Film Has Brought Alena"" tour is the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp Stadium located in Jacksonville, Florida. <br><br> In Summer 2023, I found myself home for summer break and was sad at the lack of production work I had in Jacksonville compared to Miami. Again, fortunately for me, my dad had connections that he reached out to and one of those was a media company that oversees the broadcast of Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp games. I tend to stray away from shooting baseball because it is a slow sport to shoot, however, it was the only production job offered to me. By the end of the summer, I found an appreciation for the stadium that I spent 4 or 5 nights a week at. The ambiance of the fans, sweet candied almonds, and weekend fireworks shows had grown onto me significantly. A couple of regular fans even started to recognize me as the camera girl by the home team dugout. I surprised myself with how sad I was to be shooting my last game of the summer, ultimately, signifying how much I loved the job. The most valuable part of this experience is that I can add to my resume that I was a camera operator for a professional baseball team. <br><br> This shooting location alongside the others listed above will forever resonate in my heart and mind as locations that helped me grow as a cinematographer.
